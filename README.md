## Overview
This project was done for the final API project in the FES Week 6 bootcamp. This is a continuation of the API project done in Week 4, but I chose to use another metro-related API this time. I used a public API that I created (links to <a href="https://github.com/YiJio/cantonprt/">repo</a> and <a href="https://cantonprtapi.com/">site</a>) to fetch services, lines, and stations data.
