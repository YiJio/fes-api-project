## Overview
This project is a SAMPLE using the Canton PRT API. This gives an idea of how to use the data in the API.

### Notes
This project was originally done for the final API project for the FES Week 6 bootcamp. This is a continuation of the API project done in Week 4, but I chose to use another metro-related API this time. I used a public API that I created (links to <a href="https://github.com/YiJio/cantonprt/">repo</a> and <a href="https://cantonprtapi.com/">site</a>) to fetch services, lines, and stations data.
